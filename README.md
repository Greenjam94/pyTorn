Welcome to pyTorn's documentation!
==================================

pyTorn is intended to be a pythonic interface into the Torn game
APIs. Torn is a text based RPG game. The aim of the game is to become the best. Earn the most money, own the biggest property, own the most successful company, drive the fastest car, lead the largest faction, have the most friends, complete the most missions, commit the most crime and be the strongest and hardest in Torn City.

In order to get an edge in the game, an API was provided. This interface was created to expand & enhance gameplay and not to give users an advantage which makes it easier to compete against others. This is why the project is shared in open source from the start.
